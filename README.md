## Introduction

Drone Simulator 3000 is a Java application that simulates a virtual drone arena. The simulator allows users to control drones and observe their movements within the arena. The project aims to provide an interactive and educational experience to learn about drone dynamics and obstacle avoidance.

This project was developed as a part of a software engineering course at [Your University Name].

## Features

- Create and control drones with different behaviors.
- Simulate obstacle avoidance and collision detection.
- Customize arena size and drone parameters.
- Save and load drone states for later use.
- Interactive graphical user interface.
